*see Stickman Defense War*

This is a silly little game I made as a small project for university using Python and object oriented programming with help of the pygame module

## The player has a base which (s)he has to defend against increasingly fast and strong waves of enemies

### Instructions:
Game starts automatically  
The player must click on the approaching enemies to kill them  
You gain points for killing enemies: 3 for a plane, 2 for a tank, 1 for an infantryman  
Game ends when your base is destroyed. Enjoy!
